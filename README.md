"Breast Cancer"

A breast is made up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules are the glands that produce milk. The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together. Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts or lobules. Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/what-is-breast-cancer.htm

 "A brief explanation of the dataset"

 This project is about breast cancer data in a group of people including the 213 patient observations obtained from the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital cancer registry over 24 months (January 2019â€“August 2021).The data involves eleven features: year of diagnosis, age, menopause status, tumor size in cm, number of invasive nodes, breast (left or right) affected, metastasis (yes or no), quadrant of the breast affected, history of breast disease.Furthurmore,the target(calss) is diagnosis result (benign or malignant). People who have breast cancer and healthy people . In this project, I try to analyse the dataset inorder to find the relationship between features and targetto have better understanding.
